# Goal

A very simple MEAN kit.

Angular and Node may be good friends. Even with Mongo and Bootstrap
all around. This is a proof of that: a very simple proof with some
basic routes, pages and dynamic content.

## Running project

You need to have installed Node.js and MongoDB.

### Install dependencies

To install dependencies enter project folder and run following command:

```
npm install
```

And for static libraries like Angular and Bootstrap:

```
bower install
```

### Run server

To run server execute:

```
node server.js
```

### Make Requests

```
http://localhost:8080/darwin
http://localhost:8080/dawkins
```

## Frontend

Frontend is built over Angular and Bootstrap. There are small portions
of dynamic content on some views, just as an example of how Angular
links the pieces.
